# TOP tools of Vulnerability Scanning

===============================================

Tools for Web application vulnerabilty Scanning
Web application vulnerability scanners identify security weaknesses, and popular tools include commercial options like

=>`Acunetix,`
=>`Invicti,` and
=>`Nessus,`

as well as open-source tools such as

=>`OWASP ZAP,`
=>`Nikto,` and
=>`Burp Suite`.

These tools vary in functionality, with some offering automated scanning for known vulnerabilities, while others, like ZAP and Burp Suite, provide manual penetration testing capabilities to find complex flaws.

=================================================================|
vulnerability scanning tools include:

```
=>Nessus
  ======
– This is a super easy-to-use vulnerability scanning tool that was designed to reduce the overall time and effort you may need for scanning, prioritizing, and remediating issues. It works by testing all the ports in a device individually to define its operating system. It then examines the operating system to check for any known vulnerabilities.

=>OpenVas
  =======
– This is cleverly engineered to help perform in-depth vulnerability scanning and management packaging by scanning all the network devices, and servers. It works by picking the target, e.g., a specified IP address then launching the scans according to the preferred scanning type to diagnose weaknesses.

=>Netspark
  ========
– This is a security scanner testing tool used to automate website application tests. The software can identify cross-site scripting and SQL injection attacks. This is particularly important for developers as they can use Netspark on their websites, web services, and web applications.
